Introduction:

The Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator is a web application designed to help users calculate their BMI based on their height and weight. BMI is a measure of body fat based on an individualâ€™s weight in relation to their height. This calculator provides a convenient way for users to assess their body composition and determine if they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese according to standard BMI categories.

Key Features:

1] User Input: The calculator allows users to enter their height and weight in metric units (centimeters and kilograms) or imperial units (feet, inches, and pounds).
2] BMI Calculation: The application calculates the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2. The result is then displayed to the user.
3] BMI Categories: The calculated BMI is categorized into different ranges such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. These categories provide users with an understanding of their current body 
   composition.
